    <p>Hi, I'm Natan. I'm pursuing a B.S. in Computer Engineering with a concentration in networking at UC Santa Cruz. I'm also an undergraduate research assistant with the <a href="https://ucsc-cgl.org/">Computational Genomics Laboratory</a> at the UCSC Genomics Institute, where I work on <a href="http://toil.ucsc-cgl.org/">Toil</a> and other things that aren't quite as cool as Toil.</p>
    <p>I don't really have any accomplishments, so this page is, like my wallet, mostly empty. I have a couple personal projects on <a href="https://github.com/natanlao">GitHub</a>, though.</p>
    <p>I can't imagine why you would want to get in touch with me, but if you do, you can find me online here:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://twitter.com/natanlao">Twitter</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/natanlao">GitHub</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://linkedin.com/in/natanlao">LinkedIn</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>I'm not sure who would ever need my email address either, but landing pages aren't really complete without it. You can reach me at hello at this domain.</p>
